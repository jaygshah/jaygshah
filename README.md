# Jay Shah

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at Arizona State University, working at the cross-section of Deep Learning and Medical Imaging. 

- I currently trying to improve the previously published architectures - [Deep Residual Inception Encoderâ€“Decoder Network for Medical Imaging Synthesis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8695110) & [AD-NET: Age-adjust neural network for improved MCI to AD conversion prediction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158220301273)
- My interest is in developing Interpretable Deep Learning models, potentially used for prediction and early detection of illness like [Alzheimer's Disease](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00220/full)
- These projects are joint collaborations with [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/), [Barrow Neurological Institute](https://www.barrowneuro.org/) & [Banner Alzheimer's Institute](https://www.banneralz.org/)
